## ‚ö†Ô∏è Limitations ‚ö†Ô∏è

- The widget is only designed for iPhone devices.
- The text might be too small and unreadable for some users.
- The updating rate of the widget ranges from 30 secs to 5 mins, making it unreliable.
- Sometimes Scriptable stops updating the widget, requiring a restart.

## Current Patches

As of the November 2023 Patch,

- New `B - Bendy` Bus Type added, which previously did not exist.
- There is now error handling for parameters and API errors.
- Instead of a long string of text indicating 'Undefined' for arrival times, or out-right stop working whens services end, it will now show a 'SERVICE ENDED' badge.
