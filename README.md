##  INFORMATION

An iOS Widget designed to show at a glance arrival timings of Buses directly on your lockscreen.
This only works for Singapore Public Bus Transits.

## PATCHES

As of the November 2023 Patch,
- New ```B - Bendy``` Bus Type added, which previously did not exist.
- There is now error handling for parameters and API errors.
- Instead of a long string of text indicating 'Undefined' for arrival times, or out-right stop working whens services end, it will now show a 'SERVICE ENDED' badge.
